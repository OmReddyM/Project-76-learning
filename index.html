            <br>
            <p>Black holes are collapsed stars with infinite gravity (yes, infinite!). They cannot be seen via light, so
                we detect them by looking for an absence of light. They are found at the centers of most galaxies as
                well.</p>

            <h4>Formation</h4>
            <br>
            <p>Stars, as you know, convert hydrogen into fusion at their core. This reaction releases energy in the form
                of photons, and this light pressure pushes against the force of gravity trying to pull the star in on
                itself. But if you have a star with 8-25 times the mass of the sun, it can fuse heavier elements at its
                core. When it runs out of hydrogen, it switches to helium, and then carbon, neon, etc, all the way up
                the periodic table of elements. When it reaches iron, however, the fusion reaction takes more energy
                than it produces. The star collapses instantly and then detonates, forming a neutron star. But if the
                original star had more than about 25 times the mass of the sun, the same core collapse happens. But the
                force of the material falling inward collapses the core into a black hole. A visualization of this
                collapse is shown below.</p>

            <h4>Why so black?</h4>
            <br>
            <p>As you should know, an object is visible to us via reflection of light. However, with a black hole, light
                does not come back to us from the black hole as within the event horizon of a black hole space is curved
                to the point where all paths that light might take to exit the event horizon point back inside the event
                horizon. This is the reason why light cannot escape a black hole. Another way to look at it is that the
                escape velocity from the event horizon of a black hole is faster than the speed of light. Since nothing
                can travel faster than the speed of light, nothing escapes the event horizon of a black hole.</p>

            <h4>Death of Black Holes</h4>
            <br>
            <p>During the late 20<sup>th</sup> century, Stephen Hawking discovered that there was a way for particles to
                escape a black hole. However, the chances of it occuring were unlikely. This meant it would take very
                long for this radiation to have much effect on the black hole. Since Hawking discovered it, the
                radiation was named Hawking Radiation. Even if the black hole wasn't consuming any mass, the radiation's
                effect would be little, meaning the black holes would take trillions of years to radiate away. This
                means that black holes might be the last sources of energy in a dying universe.</p>

            <p>Exoplanets are planets orbiting other stars. They can be gas giants, rocky planets or ice giants just
                like our system's planets. Scientists think that almost all stars have exoplanets orbiting them.</p>

            <h4>Formation</h4>
            <br>
            <p>Exoplanets form the same way our system's planets formed. They form from leftover material from their
                star's formation. Gas giants form from leftover gases while rocky planets form from minerals and rocks
                left over from the formation of their star.</p>

            <p>Exoplanets have 18 different categories. Some examples of their names are Cold Minuterrans, Warm
                Neptunians, Hot Terrans, Cold Superterrans and Warm Terrans. Out of all 18 categories, only 3 are
                potentially habitable. These categories are Warm Subterrans, Warm Terrans and Warm Superterrans. The

            <p>The Big Bang theory is the prevailing cosmological model explaining the existence of the observable
                universe from the earliest known periods through its subsequent large-scale evolution. The model
                describes how the universe expanded from an initial state of high density and temperature, and offers a
                comprehensive explanation for a broad range of observed phenomena, including the abundance of light
                elements, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, and large-scale structure.</p>

                    <li>10<sup>-43</sup> seconds: The cosmos undergoes an "inflation", rapidly expanding from atomic size to that of a grapefruit.</li>
